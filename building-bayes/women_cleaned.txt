Don't compromise yourself. You are all you've got. There is no yesterday, no tomorrow, it's all the same .... day.
Even though you may want to move forward in your life, you may have one foot on the brakes. In order to be free, we must learn how to let go. Release the hurt. Release the fear. Refuse to entertain your old pain. The energy it takes to hang onto the past is holding you back from a new life. What is it you would let go of today?
Everyone has talent. What is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark place where it leads.
Find out who you are and do it on purpose.
Hope is a thing with feathers
That perches in the soul;
And sings the tune without words
And never stops at all.
I am not afraidâ€¦I was born to do this.
I could not, at any age, be content to take my place by the fireside and simply look on. Life was meant to be lived. Curiosity must be kept alive. One must never, for whatever reason, turn his back on life.
I really don't think life is about the I-could-have-beens. Life is only about the I-tried-to-do. I don't mind the failure but I can't imagine that I'd forgive myself if I didn't try.
I think that somehow, we learn who we really are and then live with that decision.
If I had to live my life again, I'd make the same mistakes, only sooner.
If you realized how powerful your thoughts are, you would never think a negative thought.
If you want the rainbow, you've got to put up with the rain.
It is a wholesome and necessary thing for us to turn again to the earth and in the contemplation of her beauties to know of wonder and humility.
It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere.
It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but even more to stand up to your friends.
Learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself and know that everything in life has a purpose.
Love comes when manipulation stops; when you think more about the other person than about his or her reactions to you. When you dare to reveal yourself fully. When you dare to be vulnerable.
Love has nothing to do with what you are expecting to get â€" only what you are expecting to give â€" which is everything. What you will receive in return varies. But it really has no connection with what you give. You give because you love and cannot help giving.
Love is the only thing that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the end so easy.
Never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn.
Never let a problem to be solved become more important than the person to be loved.
No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is light from within.
Pure love is a willingness to give without a thought of receiving anything in return.
Sometimes questions are more important than answers.
Success is getting what you want; happiness is wanting what you get.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
The greater your capacity to love, the greater your capacity to feel the pain.
The more anger towards the past you carry in your heart, the less capable you are of loving in the present.
The minute you settle for less than you deserve, you get even less than you settled for.
To be kind to all, to like many and love a few, to be needed and wanted by those we love, is certainly the nearest we can come to happiness.
The soul should always stand ajar. Ready to welcome the ecstatic experience.
The thing that is really hard, and really amazing, is giving up on being perfect and beginning the work of becoming yourself.
Though I am grateful for the blessings of wealth, it hasn't changed who I am. My feet are still on the ground. I'm just wearing better shoes.
We all live with the objective of being happy; our lives are all different and yet the same.
You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, "I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along." You must do the thing you think you cannot do.
You know it's love when all you want is that person to be happy, even if you're not part of their happiness.
You never find yourself until you face the truth.
You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back.
